# Define two variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference_result = number1 - number2
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print the results
print(f'Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}')
print(f'Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}')
print(f'Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}')
Addition of 10 and 5 is 15
Subtraction of 10 and 5 is 5
Multiplication of 10 and 5 is 50
